Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This application is designed to provide an environmental licensing legislation search by means of a spatial criterion, i.e., by submiting a georreferenced drawing. It is currently designed to ease this sort of search for infrastructure projects managers persuing an environmental license in Brazil.

This application requires Ruby 2.6.6, Rails 6.0.3.3 and a Postgresql 12.5 database extended with PostGIS 3.0.

The development of this application was made possible thanks to the efforts of the Escola Nacional de Administração Pública - ENAP in providing a Coding Bootcamp course to federal civil servants in Brazil.
